# BeatBox
BeatBox is a highly interactive customizable multi-sensory experience. The major appeal of todayâ€™s most popular music platforms (specifically streaming platforms) is their focus on personalization. When a user puts on their headphones, they engage in an experience that is tailored to their mood, taste, and desire. What mobile streaming platforms do not provide, however, is such a personalized experience catered to more than a single sense. This project introduces a way to engage the visual and tactile senses in addition to the auditory senses to create a more complete and immersive experience for users.
